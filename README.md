#1. yeah so im learning react so im going to make a react app that lets you browse all the concerts the ny philharmonic has had. shout out to everyone involved with the ny phil github, heres a link https://github.com/nyphilarchive

#2. I'm basically trying to recreate the nyphil archives. I know it's not an original idea, but I don't care, it seems like it would be fun to do. I'm not copying code or anything but I think a lot of the layout of my app will be "inspired" by the archive search app on https://archives.nyphil.org/index.php

#3. This isn't for profit or anything and is, honestly, just a fun project I'm doing to try to impress employers
